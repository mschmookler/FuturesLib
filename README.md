# FuturesLib
FuturesLib aims to provide an API that allows users to implement their own
custom trading modules. It is developed specifically for trading futures and options
on futures through CME Group exchanges.

## Design goals
1. Minimize or eliminate heap allocation.
2. Simple and easy-to-use.
3. Thorough logging.

## More info
This is my first non-trivial C++ project as well as my first Github project so
expectations are low. I drew inspiration from two projects in particular: hffix and
QuantLib. Both are available on Github.

As I am clearly a beginner, suggestions are welcome.
