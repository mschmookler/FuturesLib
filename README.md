# FuturesLib
FuturesLib is a package for interacting with futures and options on futures.
Since this is my first Github project the main goal will be to practice coding
structure, style, and readability. The first version will be developed solely
to CME Globex. All suggestions are welcome.

### Version 0.0.0

Anything done while this repo is still private will be version 0.
